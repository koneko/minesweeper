# minesweeper
my recreation of the classic game where you try to find the mines and flag them as you go  
im enjoying making this and [ttt](https://github.com/koneko/tictactoe-multiplayer) as kind of a thing to do over the summer  
there is litteraly no setup, you can play it in the browser right now by clicking [this](https://hub.koneko.link/minesweeper) link
